Goal for the week (MVP) A single repo with docker-compose.yml that runs:

Web dashboard (React) + backend API (FastAPI/Node)

CMS (WordPress or Ghost) running locally

Tor/Onion routing for the CMS

IPFS node and publisher-agent that snapshots & publishes to IPFS, signs manifest.json

Discovery node (indexer) that listens on Waku or libp2p pubsub, pins manifests, exposes a simple /discover API

Demo script showing publish → discover → node stop → mirror retrieval

Minimum Acceptance Criteria (what must work) docker compose up -d launches all services and Dashboard is reachable at http://localhost:3000.

Dashboard can generate an Ed25519 keypair and show pubkey.

Dashboard can export the CMS (static export or WP export), ipfs add -r it, and produce site_cid.

manifest.json is signed and added to IPFS → manifest_cid.

Publisher-agent announces manifest_cid on discovery channel (Waku or libp2p).

Discovery node fetches manifest, verifies signature, pins site_cid and manifest_cid.

Tor onion address shown in Dashboard; reader can open via Tor Browser (demo environment).

Simulate publisher shutdown; indexer/mirror serves content from IPFS CID.

MVP scope (do this first) Local UI (publish/discover) — minimal features only.

One CMS option (start WordPress; Ghost optional).

IPFS pinning and manifest signing.

One discovery protocol: pick Waku if you want store/relay; pick libp2p if you want simpler mesh. (Plan covers both; implement one first.)

One indexer that pins and exposes simple REST API.

Simple “become a mirror” button that tells indexer to pin and optionally serve via onion.

Day-by-day plan Day 1 — Repo scaffold & core compose (bootstrap) Objective: Get a runnable docker-compose with dashboard, backend, WordPress, Tor, and IPFS. Basic wiring only.

Tasks

Create repo skeleton: /frontend, /backend, /publisher-agent, /discovery-node, /compose.

Write docker-compose.yml with services:

dashboard (React dev or simple NGINX static)

backend (FastAPI or Express; exposes /api/*)

wordpress + db (MySQL/MariaDB)

tor (containerized tor or onionize)

ipfs (ipfs/kubo)

publisher-agent (stub)

discovery-node (stub)

Backend: implement health routes: /api/health, /api/onion-status, /api/ipfs-status.

Dashboard: simple page with status tiles—one click “Generate keypair” (mock for now).

Run docker compose up -d and validate all containers start.

Deliverables

Working docker-compose.yml

Dashboard that shows container status

README with run instructions

Acceptance check

docker compose up -d runs without errors

http://localhost:3000 loads dashboard

Day 2 — Publisher-agent: export, IPFS add, signing Objective: Implement publisher-agent to export site, add to IPFS, build signed manifest.

Tasks

Choose export method:

WordPress: use wp export or wget / httrack for static snapshot; or use WP2Static plugin (if time).

Ghost: ghost export or ghost-cli export. For MVP, static export via wget --mirror or WP REST API -> static build is fastest.

Implement publisher-agent endpoints:

POST /api/publish — runs export, ipfs add -r public/, returns site_cid.

POST /api/sign-manifest — creates manifest.json and signs using Ed25519; uses local keyfile or generates keypair.

Add Ed25519 sign/verify utilities (Python pynacl or Node tweetnacl).

Add code to ipfs add manifest.json and return manifest_cid.

Dashboard: create a Publish form that triggers /api/publish.

Commands / snippets

ipfs add -r public/ → parse CID

sign manifest (pseudo):

from nacl.signing import SigningKey sk = SigningKey.generate() pk = sk.verify_key.encode().hex() signature = sk.sign(manifest_bytes).signature.hex() Store the private key encrypted on disk (simple password prompt for MVP).

Deliverables

publisher-agent that returns site_cid and manifest_cid

Dashboard publishes and displays CIDs and onion

Acceptance check

Publish flow completes and returns manifest_cid and site_cid.

Day 3 — Tor + Onion exposure; show onion in UI Objective: Connect CMS to Tor and display onion hostname in dashboard.

Tasks

Configure Tor hidden service to point to wordpress:80 (container link) via tor container torrc.

HiddenServiceDir -> mount to host volume to read hostname.

HiddenServicePort 80 wordpress:80

Backend reads /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname and exposes it via /api/onion-url.

Dashboard shows onion URL and a QR code.

Sanity test with Tor Browser (open onion URL) — but for demo environment you can show the file content and explain access via Tor.

Deliverables

Onion hostname exposed in Dashboard

Tor container and hidden service files in repo

Acceptance check

Dashboard shows onion address file contents.

Day 4 — Discovery mechanism (pick Waku or libp2p) and indexer Objective: Implement discovery announcement (publisher → pubsub) and indexer that subscribes, fetches, verifies, pins.

Decision (pick one now for speed):

If you expect intermittent readers: use Waku (store/relay helps availability).

If you control indexer peers only: use libp2p gossipsub (easy to implement with js-libp2p/go-libp2p).

Tasks

Implement pubsub announce in publisher-agent:

Small message: { type: "announce", manifest_cid: "Qm...", timestamp }

Publish to chosen topic.

Implement discovery-node:

Subscribe to topic; on message manifest_cid: ipfs get manifest_cid

Validate signature: verify manifest.signature using manifest.pubkey

Pin manifest_cid and site_cid via IPFS API: curl -X POST http://ipfs:5001/api/v0/pin/add?arg=

Store manifest in local SQLite DB for UI queries.

Dashboard Explore tab queries discovery-node GET /discover?tag=xyz and lists matched manifests.

Deliverables

Working announcement + indexer

Discovery API at http://localhost:backendport/discover

Acceptance check

After publish, indexer logs show fetched manifest, verified signature, pinned site_cid.

Day 5 — UI polish: publish/discover/mirror flows; “Become a mirror” Objective: Make the UI usable and demo-ready: Publish button, Explore list, Mirror button.

Tasks

Dashboard:

Publish page: content preview, show onion + site CID + manifest CID.

Explore page: list manifests, show tags, pubkey, onion, mirror status.

Mirror button: POST /api/mirror to discovery-node to pin manifest_cid + site_cid.

Backend endpoints:

POST /api/mirror calls indexer pin API.

GET /api/manifests returns pinned manifests with mirror info.

Add small UX: “Nuke data” to wipe local key & local DB (safety CTA).

Quick styling (Tailwind) for clarity.

Deliverables

Dashboard with Publish/Explore/Mirror

Mirror function that pins content and optionally creates onion proxy (indexer can run tiny static server or onion rehost — optional)

Acceptance check

Reader can click Mirror → indexer pins site → indexer shows mirror onion or gateway URL.

Day 6 — Resilience tests, node-down scenarios, and demo script Objective: Test robustness, automate node stop/start scenarios, finalize demo script.

Tasks

Test case: Publish → Confirm discover → Stop wordpress + publisher-agent. Validate:

Tor onion unreachable.

IPFS site_cid still served via indexer mirror or ipfs cat works.

Add automated test scripts:

scripts/publish_test.sh that runs publish flow.

scripts/simulate_failure.sh stops publisher and verifies indexer serves site_cid.

Create final demo script with exact commands and outputs (see Demo section below).

Write short docs/demo.md and docs/architecture.md.

Deliverables

Test scripts

Demo script and documentation

Acceptance check

Simulated failure shows mirror serving content.

Day 7 — Packaging, installer, and submission pack Objective: Make it easy for non-technical users and prepare deliverables.

Tasks

Create simple installer script:

install.sh — checks Docker, downloads repo, runs docker compose up -d.

On first run, opens http://localhost:3000.

Create demo-recording.sh script that runs headless publish and discovery and logs outputs for a short screencast.

Finalize README.md with one-line install, quickstart, privacy notes, and links to demo video.

Prepare challenge submission package:

summary.md (one page), docs/, link to GitHub, 3-5 minute demo video (recorded using demo-recording.sh + screen recording).

Optional: build a release tarball or Docker Compose single-file with pinned versions.

Deliverables

install.sh

Release tar.gz or GitHub release

docs/ and demo video plan

Acceptance check

Fresh VM user can run install.sh and reach dashboard at http://localhost:3000.

Final demo script (what you’ll show — concise, 4–5 minutes) Start stack: docker compose up -d — show Dashboard at http://localhost:3000.

Dashboard: generate keypair → create a short post → Publish.

Show site_cid and manifest_cid displayed.

Watch Discovery page auto-list the manifest (or show indexer logs: fetched manifest).

Open Tor Browser to onion address (or show indexer onion / IPFS gateway) — page loads.

Simulate failure: docker compose stop wordpress publisher-agent — Tor site fails. Explain expected behavior.

Show retrieval from IPFS via indexer: open indexer mirror URL or ipfs cat /ipfs/<site_cid> → page loads.

Re-start publisher: docker compose start wordpress publisher-agent → node re-announces (indexer logs confirm).

Final slide: architecture diagram + TL;DR of privacy and resilience guarantees.

Implementation notes & tech tips (quick reference) Key storage: store privkey encrypted with password in /data/keys/; make UI ask for password on startup.

Signing format: manifest + signature field (base64). Use ed25519 for short keys and libs available in Node/Python.

IPFS API: pin via POST /api/v0/pin/add?arg= on port 5001.

Tor: expose hidden service hostname file into an attached volume. Read it from backend to show onion url.

Waku vs libp2p: implement one; if time allows, implement Waku store on discovery node for intermittent readers.

Security: disable WP plugins that phone home; disable logging or rotate logs; provide “nuke data” in UI.

Risk, mitigation, and stretch items Risks

Pubsub messages lost if no indexers exist.

IPFS objects garbage-collected if not pinned by others.

Tor hidden service availability depends on local node.

Mitigation

Encourage at least 2 volunteer indexers (run with your demo).

Automate pinning to a public pinning service or web3.storage (optional paid).

Provide easy “export zip” so humans can mirror offline.

Stretch (post-MVP)

Curator lists & Bloom-filter discovery

Encrypted keyword discovery (PSI)

Filecoin snapshots for paid long-term persistence

Electron wrapper for truly “desktop app” UX

Deliverables at week end Git repo with full docker-compose.yml, frontend, backend, publisher-agent, discovery-node, indexer.

install.sh + README + docs.

Demo recording and demo.md.

Minimal security/privacy model doc.

If you want, I’ll now generate the starter repo files for Day 1 — a ready docker-compose.yml, a minimal FastAPI backend, a simple React dashboard skeleton, and the publisher-agent sign/publish script (Ed25519 + IPFS commands). Tell me which language you prefer for backend (Python/FastAPI or Node/Express) and whether you want Waku or libp2p implemented first; I’ll produce the code immediately.

You said: Can you give me a detailed diagram of how everything fits together? ChatGPT said: Here’s a detailed architecture diagram (in text form) showing how all components of your censorship-resistant publishing system fit together, integrating WordPress/Ghost, Tor, IPFS, and Waku/libp2p.

I’ll break it down into layers and then describe the full data flow.

Publishing a New Site or Article The user installs your Docker package — it auto-runs Tor, Ghost/WordPress, IPFS, and Waku nodes.
The CMS (WordPress or Ghost) runs locally and serves content.

Onionize exposes it as a .onion site.

The IPFS node:

Hashes & pins site snapshot or article.

Generates a manifest.json like:

{ "site_name": "FreeVoices", "onion": "abcd1234.onion", "ipfs_cid": "QmXYZ...", "pubkey": "ed25519:abc...", "tags": ["india", "activism"], "timestamp": 1728412342 } This manifest is signed and published via:

IPFS (pinned + DHT).

Waku or libp2p pubsub topic (e.g. /freevoices/discovery).

Discovery & Reading Other users running the Discovery UI (a small React or Electron app) subscribe to the same Waku topic.
They fetch the latest manifests → which contain .onion URLs and IPFS CIDs.

When clicking an entry:

If Tor is enabled → open .onion link.

Otherwise → fetch IPFS CID from a gateway or local node.

Cached manifests and content ensure resilience if the original node is offline.

When a Node Dies or Goes Offline The .onion address becomes unreachable.
But:

The IPFS CID content remains accessible if it’s pinned by mirrors.

The manifest remains discoverable via Waku/libp2p (historical messages or DHT).

Optionally, community nodes automatically mirror or republish content based on tags or trust rules.

Optional Enhancements Arweave backup for permanence.
PGP or DID signature verification of manifests.

Moderation tags (optional—encrypted lists shared via Waku).

Offline-first reader that syncs manifests periodically.

🛠️ Implementation Notes Docker Compose stack:

Prepackaged with Ghost, Tor, IPFS, Waku nodes.

One-click docker-compose up runs everything locally.

Frontend (Discovery UI):

Fetches manifests from Waku or IPFS.

Shows a grid of publishers with tags, timestamps, and onion/IPFS links.

CLI tool (freevoices publish) for automation:

Exports your CMS data → IPFS.

Signs + publishes manifest to Waku.

💡 Demo Scenarios To show the system’s power:

Demo 1 — “Instant Publishing” Start your Docker stack.

Write a post in WordPress.

Auto-publish → shows up on another peer’s Discovery UI within seconds (via Waku).

Demo 2 — “Resilient Content” Kill the original node.

Reader still accesses the post via IPFS mirror.

Demo 3 — “Anonymous Discovery” Show new publishers appearing in the UI as manifests propagate — without any central registry.

Would you like me to draw a visual architecture diagram (flowchart-style) for this next? I can generate a clean labeled diagram showing the full data flow (nodes, Tor, IPFS, Waku, CMS, Discovery UI).
